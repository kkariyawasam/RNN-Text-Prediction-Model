# RNN-Text-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented using Python and deep learning libraries for the purpose of sequential data modeling.

# Features

- Cleaned and tokenized text data for training
- RNN-based model built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Model trained on sequences of characters or words
- Text generation or sequence prediction based on trained model
